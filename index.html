          <p id="p3">Back after I finished my high-school, I joined a certificate ICDL programme
             just around my home locale. Little did I know this would become the time of
             my life.After tremendously fairing in the computer packages, the lecturer 
             approached us and suggested a new programming course he was offering to teach
             at fair price.I never knew anything about programming languages,all I knew was<br/>
             <span class="italic">'It's a complex field'</span> <strong>No it isn't.</strong> <br/>
             I enrolled and by the time I was finishing the programme, I was sure this was going
             to be my life.So here I am, after a long period of growth after that, <strong><em> Ready to work with
             you.</em></strong><br/><span class="bolder" >Check out  some of my works below</span>
